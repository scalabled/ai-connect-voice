```

## Implementation Details

### Algorithms and Data Structures
- **Extraction Algorithm**: LLM prompt: "From this transcript: [responses], extract attributes: [list questions/attributes]. Prioritize most interesting details."
- **Matching Algorithm**: Vector embeddings for attributes; top-K matches using similarity search (e.g., FAISS library).
- **Voice Script**: Sequential questions with pauses; e.g., "Where do you work?" followed by "What industry do you specialize in?"
- **Data Structures**: Hash maps for quick attribute lookups; sets for unique keywords.
- **Design Implementation**: Use CSS variables for colors (e.g., --primary-orange: #F97316); ensure logo variants are used appropriately (e.g., Orange Logo on light backgrounds).

### Guidelines
- **Best Practices**: Use asynchronous processing for voice calls; ensure inclusivity in matching (e.g., diverse roles). Follow logo guidelines: No alterations, ensure contrast.
- **Examples**:
  - Use Case: User signs up, answers questions via call; receives email with 3 matches (e.g., "Connect with Jane, a Founder in AI startups").
  - Edge Case: Incomplete responses → Prompt for clarification or use defaults.
